#### Setup and Configure Servers

In this section, we will proceed with the process of setting up and configuring servers. Firstly, we will create a **Bastion Host** in the Public Subnet, allowing secure access to the application servers in the Private Subnet. Next, an **EC2 Setup Server** will be created in the Private Subnet to prepare for the application deployment. Once configured, we will download source code from an **S3 Bucket** onto the EC2 Setup Server and update the database into the **RDS Instance**.
