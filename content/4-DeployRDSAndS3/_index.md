#### Database and Storage Service Deployment

In this section, we will configure important services such as databases and storage. Firstly, we will create a **DB Subnet Group** for the database to ensure a secure network environment. Next, we will create an **RDS Instance** and adjust technical settings as required. Then, we will create an **S3 Bucket** to store the application source code and upload necessary files. To manage access permissions to the S3 bucket, we need to create an **IAM role** with appropriate policies. Finally, we will deploy an **EFS file system** to store and share data among EC2 instances.
